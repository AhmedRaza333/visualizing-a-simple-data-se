📘 Task 1: Data Exploration & Visualization – Iris Dataset

Intern: Ahmed Raza Attari
Program: Data Science & Analytics Internship
Organization: DevelopersHub Corporation

🎯 Objective

The goal of this task was to explore and analyze the famous Iris dataset using Python. This helped in developing core skills like data inspection, summarization, and basic visual storytelling through plots. It served as an essential step toward understanding the nature of real-world datasets before applying any machine learning models.

🧰 Tools & Libraries

Pandas – for data loading and basic structure inspection

Matplotlib – for simple plotting and layout control

Seaborn – for advanced and clean statistical visualizations

📊 Work Summary

Loaded the Iris dataset directly from seaborn's sample datasets.

Performed a quick structural check:

.shape to view dataset size

.columns to see feature names

.head() to preview first few rows

Visualized the dataset using:

Scatter Plot – to explore relationships between features like petal length vs petal width

Histogram – to examine value distribution for each feature

Box Plot – to detect outliers and observe spread of values for each flower species

🔍 Key Learnings

Understood how to load and explore structured datasets in Python.

Learned how different types of plots reveal insights from data.

Developed basic understanding of data distributions, feature relationships, and outlier detection.

✅ Outcome

By completing this task, I gained confidence in handling small datasets and visualizing them effectively. This hands-on practice will help in future tasks involving feature selection, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

📌 Dataset Used: Iris Dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) via seaborn.load_dataset('iris')
